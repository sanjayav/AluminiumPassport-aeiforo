This is a placeholder for a sample ZIP file containing passport data examples.

In a real implementation, this would be a binary ZIP file containing:
1. sample_passports.json - JSON array of passport objects
2. sample_passports.csv - CSV file with passport data
3. README.txt - Instructions for batch upload

The ZIP file would demonstrate the expected format for bulk passport uploads.
